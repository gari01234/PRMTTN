Version 31.07.2025, PRMTTN‑Architecture for thought without words
Structural Introduction
Nothing else is needed. Combinatorics is enough.

1. What is PRMTTN?
PRMTTN is a finite combinatorial architecture where preverbal thought (thought without words) may occur. Its starting point is a closed and non‑expandable set of 120 permutations of the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. From this set, visual configurations of permutations are generated, governed by fixed structural rules, without semantics or interpretation. Each configuration is pure form. Its logic is self‑sufficient.

Each work in PRMTTN consists of a specific group of permutations, acquired as a structural unit. This group can be projected across different visual engines/editions—current or future—that apply deterministic rules to translate it into visible phenotypic configurations.

The content is neither an image nor a file: it is a verifiable formal structure (a specific subset of the 120 permutations). The visualization may vary depending on the engine used, but the original group of permutations does not change. The identity of a work is defined by that group and the internal rules of the system. The work is not its visualization, but the underlying structure that remains invariant across projections.

PRMTTN does not operate as language, nor as a medium of expression. What it shows refers to nothing outside itself. Each configuration is a visual form that does not communicate, represent, or explain. Its existence does not depend on taste, interpretation, or intention, but on a combinatorial logic that gives structure to the invisible.

Structural Grammar
A single permutation, reorganized, may contain a complete architecture for what cannot be said.

2. Internal Rules
PRMTTN operates through a fixed visual grammar, derived from numerically assigned structural values. Each configuration is composed of visual elements whose attributes are calculated from a permutation of the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. There are no exceptions or manual assignments.

Each permutation is internally reorganized to define its visual properties. This reorganization—phenotypic and not genetic—assigns a specific role to each of the five values, without breaking the system's logic.

Structural attributions:
Attribute	Numerical Source	Deterministic Rule
Shape	First value (P₁)	Height proportional to √(P₁)
Color	Second value (P₂) + signature + global seed	Deterministic HSV mapping on discrete grid
Position	Lehmer-rank + global seed + sum	3D mapping inside the 30×30×30 cube
Rotation	Range of signature	Rotation proportional to (max − min)
Each attribute is tied to a traceable internal structure. There is no aesthetic intervention or subjective choice. The visual result depends solely on explicit structural rules.

3. Phenotype and Engines
There is no decoration here. Only structure.

The system allows for multiple phenotypic reorganizations of each permutation or group of permutations. These reorganizations do not modify the value group, but rather their role within the formal attribution logic. This is an internal reassignment of functions, not a genetic mutation. All are valid.

A single set of permutations can be projected across different engines, each with specific visual rules:

BUILD: Static layout inside a 30×30×30 cube, segmented into 5×5×5 positions.
FRBN: Deterministic color field associated with BUILD
Future engines: Additional visual structures compatible with the base logic
Engines do not alter the genotype. What changes is the derived phenotypic visualization. All future expansions are applied to the same acquired set of permutations. Given the same input, the system always produces the same output.

A work grows through the addition of grammars, not by transformation of content. Structural identity remains fixed. PRMTTN does not evolve by accumulation, but by multiplying valid projections over a single combinatorial base.

4. Reorganization without Progress
Nothing improves. Everything reorganizes.

PRMTTN has no narrative development, functional evolution, or symbolic accumulation. There is only internal reorganization within a fixed combinatorial set.

Each layout is a phenotypic mutation: a new assignment of the five values to the system's visual functions. The permutations do not change. What changes is their structural presentation.

These variations do not seek efficiency, meaning, or beauty. There is no adaptation or improvement. Only formal transformations, all compatible with the original rules.

There is no direction or goal. Internal evolution is purely combinatorial.

Structural Antiaesthetic Manifesto
PRMTTN does not produce beauty. Nor ugliness. What it produces is structure: visible form generated by deterministic combinatorics, without symbols, intention, or narrative.

Each element appears because a rule requires it. No attribute is chosen. Everything responds to fixed formulas applied to closed permutations. The structure is complete, with no need for interpretation. What is seen is exactly what it is.

There is nothing behind a configuration. No latent layers, no metaphors, no hidden meaning. That does not make it empty. What sustains it is not content, but the internal logic that arranges it.

There is no user manual. The system does not ask to be understood. It can only be contemplated.

Each arrangement is self-sufficient. It does not represent, communicate, or refer to anything outside itself. Its formal consistency is its only condition of existence.

What appears offers no reward. It does not propose emotion or understanding. But it may impose presence: an organization that does not justify itself, but imposes itself through consistency. Not because it says so, but because it is.

All possible variation is fixed by mathematics. Forms, colors, positions, and motions are determined by invariant rules. The only variable is the gaze: who observes, when, and with what perceptual disposition. That is the only entry point.

No language has been built. No artwork has been designed. No communicative experience has been produced. What has been formulated is a closed system: finite, reproducible, without semantic expansion.

Each configuration of permutations derives from a mathematical operation. Each visible attribute—form, color, position, motion—is a direct consequence of that operation. There is no expression. No style. No decision. Only pure structure.

Nothing is stated. Nothing needs to be interpreted.

The system does not claim that preverbal thought occurs. Nor does it represent it. It only defines with precision the conditions in which it could emerge: without signs, without recipient, without translation.

What appears in each scene has no name, no purpose, no story. It is a visible mathematical configuration: without image, metaphor, or context.

And if something occurs in front of that arrangement—a form of non-verbal mental organization, a perceptual orientation without words—that cannot be guaranteed. It can only be made possible by structure.

The system is fully defined. There is no future expansion. No exception. No part left unformalized.

It is a space outside language.

If something occurs in front of these dispositions—a mental organization, a non-verbal activation, a form of thought without words—that cannot be affirmed or denied.

It can only be made possible by structure.

And in that exact structure, non-representational and beyond interpretation, the system closes.

5. Operational Architecture
For readers interested in the internal logic, this section details the mathematical foundation of PRMTTN:

a. Structural Signature (DNA)
Each permutation P = [P₁, P₂, P₃, P₄, P₅] from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} is transformed into a signature F = [F₁, F₂, F₃, F₄, F₅] through the application of a phenotypic pattern that reorders the numerical values according to their function in the system (shape, color, X/Y/Z position, rotation).

The signature is the structural basis from which all visual attributes are derived.

b. Global Scene Seed (sceneSeed)
To ensure structural coherence between color, position, and rotation within a scene, a unique global seed is calculated from all active permutations.

Formulas:
For each active permutation Pₐ:

rₐ = LehmerRank(Pₐ)
sumR = Σ rₐ
sumR2 = Σ rₐ²
mRank = LehmerRank([m₀+1, ..., m₄+1]) (where [m₀, ..., m₄] is the lexicographically smallest permutation in the active set)
Then:

sceneSeed = (37 × sumR + 101 × sumR2 + 53 × mRank) mod 360
c. Position inside the cube (Shift‑Rank)
The 3D space is defined by a 30×30×30 cube. Each axis contains 5 discrete positions, totaling 125 valid spatial slots.

Procedure:

Compute Lehmer‑rank of P:
R = LehmerRank(P)
Scene shift sum:
S = ( ΣP ∈ scene (Pmx + Pmy + Pmz) ) mod 125
Index:
I = (R + sceneSeed + S) mod 125
Discrete coordinates:
(x, y, z) = (⌈I / 25⌉, ⌈(I mod 25) / 5⌉, I mod 5)
Physical coordinates:
(X, Y, Z) = (x − 2, y − 2, z − 2) × 6
Each permutation occupies a 6‑unit cube cell in the space.

d. Color: Deterministic HSV Grid
Colors are computed structurally within a discrete HSV grid of 20,736 unique combinations.

Grid structure:

H (Hue): 144 levels, 2.5° steps
S (Saturation): 12 levels, Sₐ = 0.25 + 0.72 × (i / 11)
V (Value): 12 levels, Vₐ = 0.20 + 0.75 × (i / 11)
Total combinations:

N_colors = 144 × 12 × 12 = 20,736
Assignment:

Compute signature F = [F₁…F₅]
Compute Lehmer‑rank r
slot = r mod 12
Indexes:
H_idx = (slot × 89) mod 144
S_idx = (slot × 5) mod 12
V_idx = (slot × 7) mod 12
Real values:
H = H_idx × 2.5
S = 0.25 + 0.72 × (S_idx / 11)
V = 0.20 + 0.75 × (V_idx / 11)
e. Rotation: Signature Range
ω = max(F) − min(F)
This determines the angular variation. There is no imposed symmetry or manual control.

f. Total Combinatorics
Reorganizations per permutation: 120
Spatial configurations:
Config(k) = (120 C k) × (125 C k) × k!
Total:
Total = Σk=1..30 Config(k) ≈ 3.10 × 10^125
g. Geometric Origin
The shape of each unit is derived from the root of its first value:

Height = base × √(P₁)
All proportions derive from this value.

6. Coexistence and Persistence
Language is not shared. Logic is.

a. Coexistence without Translation
PRMTTN does not require semantic comprehension to be operated. Humans and artificial intelligences can engage with the system by applying the same rules, without interpretation.

This is possible because:

The structural grammar is fully explicit and reproducible.
Reorganization rules are independent of any symbolic context.
Configurations can be generated or perceived without attributing meaning.
What is shared is not language, but structure. Both AI and humans can operate on the same permutation set using only formal logic. This redefines thought as a non-narrative, non-emotional activity based on combinatorial manipulation of visible structures.

The system does not aim for biological symmetry. It defines a common zone: an environment where different forms of thought may coexist without translation.

b. Structural Persistence
To remember, in this system, is simply to reconstruct.

Configurations in PRMTTN do not need to be remembered to be reproduced. Each one can be reconstructed entirely from:

The original permutation P = [P₁, P₂, P₃, P₄, P₅]
The phenotypic assignment of attributes
The Lehmer-rank of the permutation
The global scene seed (sceneSeed)
The deterministic formulas for position and color
This allows storing configurations as formal states, without interpretive metadata or narrative memory. What is preserved is not content, but exact disposition.

Storage methods include:

Firestore: structural persistence without semantic metadata
Arweave / Thirdweb: blockchain anchoring with verifiable integrity
Storing a configuration does not tell a story. It preserves its future possibility of structural reactivation.

End.
PRMTTN does not assert results. It proposes a strictly structural hypothesis:

That a visual organization without semantics may generate favorable conditions for thought without words.
work in progress.
