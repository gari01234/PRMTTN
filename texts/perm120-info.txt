The 120 architectural permutations are the 120 ways to reassign P₁–P₅ to the attributes [shape, color, x, y, z]. The architecture (the set of selected permutations) does not change; what changes is its visual phenotype by deciding which component controls each spatial and chromatic attribute.
These reconstructions do not add semantics, do not break the logic of the system, and remain within the combinatorial framework. They reorganize the structural availability of pre‑verbal thought.

Each of the 120 reorganizations is validated by its internal structural coherence, not by usefulness or beauty.
“Evolution” is goal‑free reordering: same architecture, 120 phenotypic expressions.
